//  Program name: Volatility Test of GPRs across printf
//  Programming languages: One modules in C and two modules in X86, one module in C++
//  Date program began:     2020-Sep-18
//  Date program completed: 2020-Sep-18
//  Date comments upgraded: 2020-Sep-18
//  Files in this program: integerdriver.c, arithmetic.asm, atol.asm (lib), validate-decimal-digits.cpp (lib), showgprs.asm (lib)
//  Files labeled "lib" are library files containing source code.  They are borrowed without modification for use here.
//  Library programs do not carry documented comments about this specific program named "Volatility Test of GPRs across printf"
//  because they are used in many application programs.
//  Status: Complete.

//Program history

//
//Purpose
//  Purpose: Empirically test the state of general purpose registers before a call to printf and immediately 
//  the call to printf has terminated.  Four tests have been included in this program and the results have
//  been tabulated.  Four test cases does not 'prove' anything, but four test cases do provide strong 
//  evidence about which registers are always modified by printf, sometimes modified by printf, or never 
//  modified by printf.
