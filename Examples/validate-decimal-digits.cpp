//chars in the array are within that range a value true will be returned, otherwise a value false will be returned.          *

//To students in CPSC240:  This is my opinion.  I have studied the the available licenses for software especially the GPL,
//the LGPL, and the Affero GPL.  This is what I have learned about the LGPL used with this function "isinteger".
//   The section above the blank line is called the "copyright notice".
//   The section below the blank line is called the "license notice".
//   LGPL is for use on software typically found in software libraries.
//   This LGPL license applies only to the specific function named in the license.
//   This library may be used within another application covered by other licenses (or EULAs).
//   This license requires that source code of this function be distributed with the application (even if other parts of the
//       application are not required to be distributed with source code).
//   This LGPL allows you to re-distribute the function (provided the original LGPL remains).
//   This LGPL allows you to modify the function (provided the original LGPL remains).
//   This LGPL allows you to distribute (or sell) your modified versions to anyone (provided the original LGPL remains). 
//   When you distribute this software to other people a copy of the LGPL is suppose to accompany the source code in a 
//       separate file.  If that separate file becomes lost (by human error) license still has legal standing.

//A example: Microsoft programmers are developing a new version of Minecraft.  One of the programmers on that project
//discovers a useful function stored online that can be used in the new version of Minecraft.  If that online function is 
//licensed by GPL and Microsoft uses it, then Microsoft must make all of Minecraft open source and licensed by GPL.  However, 
//if that online function is licensed by LGPL then Microsoft may legally incorporate the function into Minecraft, and 
//Minecraft remains proprietary and wholly secret.  Do you see a major difference between the two kinds of licenses?

//This opinion is included here for educational purposes in the course CPSC240.  You must remove this opinion statement 
//when you use this library function in other application programs such as homework.
//
//To students in 240:  You must remove this block of opinion statements when you use this function in your program.  If this
//block remains when I grade your program then automatically your program is not professional.//

//  This is a library function.  It does not belong to any one specific application.  The function is available for inclusion 
//  in other applications.  If it is included in another application and there are no modifications made to the executing 
//  statements in this file then do not modify the license and do not modify any part of this file; use it as is.

//Future project
//  Re-write this function in X86 assembly.
//
//How to call isinteger from an X86 module:
//  == Declare isinteger to be exist externally: extern isinteger
//  == Obtain an address pointing to valid memory.  Such an address can be a resgister like rsp or a declared array like mystuff resq 300
//  == Do the setup block for isinteger:
//     == mov rax,0
//     == mov rdi, <a register>        or         mov rdi,mystuff
//     == call isinteger
//     == mov r15, rax      ;Copy the returned number to a safer location such as r15.
//
//How to call isinteger from a C function
//  ==Place the prototype near the top of the calling function:  bool isinteger(char []);
//  ==Declare a bool variable:  bool outcome;
//  ==Create an array:  char wonder[200];
//  ==Fill the array with a null-terminate sequence of chars.
//  ==Call the function:  outcome = isinteger(wonder)
//
//

//#include <cstring>
